<h1> Opening research beyond open access and open data: the Documenta?! experience </h1>
Anne Clinio

<h2>Abstract</h2>
This presentation shares initial learnings from the experience of opening the Documenta?! research project with the support of Mozilla Open Leaders mentoring program. It emphasizes that the notion of opening goes beyond the economic, legal, technical and editorial aspects mobilized by the dominant discourse of Open Science. "Open leadership" should be able to build projects that mobilize diverse and inclusive communities that broaden the notion of openness to themes such as the pattern of interaction among community members, values exchange (not in the monetary sense but as a principle ), engagement, diversity, inclusiveness, accessibility, security and cultural change.

<h2>Proposal</h2>
Currently, several actors working in the Science, Technology and Innovation system are fostering the adoption of the open paradigm in processes of production and communication of scientific knowledge. They emphasize the open access to literature and the opening of data that subsidize publications published both in articles in periodicals and in the pre-print format. The dominant discourse of Open Science mobilizes the notion of openness to promote a utilitarian view of science that values potential benefits such as greater effectiveness, productivity and competitiveness. In this sense, openness is opposed to artificial obstacles that hinder the broad circulation of scientific knowledge of order:

* Economic - Refers to the amounts charged by commercial publishers for access to scientific journals content through paywalls that make short library budgets and, ultimately, block research. Or, more recently the collection of authorÂ´s processing cost (APCs) that transfer the financial burden from subscribers to authors.

* Legal - The abusive use of copyright by the publishing industries is considered harmful for creating an "artificial scarcity" of intellectual property and block the circulation of relevant information. If, on the one hand, copyright protects intellectual property through the granting of temporary exclusivity, on the other hand, it should not overlap fundamental rights such as access to information, knowledge, education etc.

* Technical - The adoption of open formats is considered more adequate to promote the circulation of information because it favors the preservation of documents in the long term and the interoperability between systems. Besides that, it avoids the dependence of suppliers that monopolize a format.

*  Editorial - Refers to the intermediation of knowledge communication by gatekeepers (editors, authors and anonymous reviewers) that define priority themes, formats, scientific quality criteria etc. In short, what is publishable (or not) in scientific journals. Editorial policies favor the publication of "successful" experiments rather than so-called "failed" experiments, conflicting with the idiosyncrasies of an activity that is characterized by "trial and error". This characteristic drastically reduce the amount of relevant information available.
