<h1> Opening research beyond open access and open data: the Documenta?! experience </h1>
Anne Clinio

<h2>Abstract</h2>
This presentation shares initial learnings from the experience of opening the Documenta?! research project with the support of Mozilla Open Leaders mentoring program. It emphasizes that the notion of opening goes beyond the economic, legal, technical and editorial aspects mobilized by the dominant discourse of Open Science. "Open leadership" should be able to build projects that mobilize diverse and inclusive communities that broaden the notion of openness to themes such as the pattern of interaction among community members, values exchange (not in the monetary sense but as a principle ), engagement, diversity, inclusiveness, accessibility, security and cultural change.

<h2>Case study</h2>
Currently, several actors working in the Science, Technology and Innovation system are fostering the adoption of the open paradigm in processes of production and communication of scientific knowledge. They emphasize the open access to literature and the opening of data that subsidize publications published both in articles in periodicals and in the pre-print format. The dominant discourse of Open Science mobilizes the notion of openness to promote a utilitarian view of science that values potential benefits such as greater effectiveness, productivity and competitiveness. In this sense, openness is opposed to artificial obstacles that hinder the broad circulation of scientific knowledge of order:

* Economic - Refers to the amounts charged by commercial publishers for access to scientific journals content through paywalls that make short library budgets and, ultimately, block research. Or, more recently the collection of author´s processing cost (APCs) that transfer the financial burden from subscribers to authors.

* Legal - The abusive use of copyright by the publishing industries is considered harmful for creating an "artificial scarcity" of intellectual property and block the circulation of relevant information. If, on the one hand, copyright protects intellectual property through the granting of temporary exclusivity, on the other hand, it should not overlap fundamental rights such as access to information, knowledge, education etc.

* Technical - The adoption of open formats is considered more adequate to promote the circulation of information because it favors the preservation of documents in the long term and the interoperability between systems. Besides that, it avoids the dependence of suppliers that monopolize a format.

*  Editorial - Refers to the intermediation of knowledge communication by gatekeepers (editors, authors and anonymous reviewers) that define priority themes, formats, scientific quality criteria etc. In short, what is publishable (or not) in scientific journals. Editorial policies favor the publication of "successful" experiments rather than so-called "failed" experiments, conflicting with the idiosyncrasies of an activity that is characterized by "trial and error". This characteristic drastically reduce the amount of relevant information available. 

Mozilla Open Leaders is a 14 weeks mentoring program sponsored by the Mozilla Foundation that aims to "strengthen open projects and communities around the world," envisioning that its "open leaders" will be able to build projects that empower others to collaborate in diverse and inclusive communities. It is expected that participants develop their "open leadership" from adopting principles and practices that mobilize communities to set shared goals and solve common problems from a diverse and inclusive perspective.

Here, the notion of open differs from the dominant discourse of Open Science because, in addition to economic, legal, technical and editorial obstacles, it proposes to open up other cultures, references, experiences, understandings, epistemic matrices ... It seems that those aspects are currently relegated to a secondary debate within the Open Science movement, circumscribed to the "niche" of "citizen science." Alternatively, the new perspective faces other barriers, such as pattern of interaction among community members, exchanged values (principles), engagement, diversity, inclusiveness, accessibility, security, and cultural change.

In other words, while an "open by default" perspective may be vague (imprecise) and authoritarian (when mandatory), puting people at risk (for example, activists) or simply limit the assignment of a permissive license, open by design, fostered by Mozilla Open Leaders, stimulates intentionally designed knowledge production and communication practices that promote both inclusive governance, open collaboration, appreciation of the diversity of its members, and equitable recognition of its contributions.

In Documenta?!, proposed by the Anne Clinio as a result of the doctoral research "New laboratory notebooks and new epistemic cultures: between the policy of the experiment and the experiment of the policy", the notion of openness has been operationalized from: 

*Promotion of collaboration*

- It clearly describes the purpose of the project - "To know, to study and to systematize documentation practices developed by professionals in laboratories, especially laboratories of citizens, makerspaces, hackerspaces, spaces of informal learning, etc."

- Describes the problem to be solved - The current practices of citizen laboratories reduce documentation to bureaucratic activity rather than promoting it as a projection of alternative futures.

- Describes vision / premises - Considers documentation to be crucial for the sustainability of initiatives, encouragement of co-creation processes and wide adoption of solutions. It allows you to engage people, share visions, foster communities, inspire initiatives, and reproduce objects.

*Promotes participation*

- Indicates ways to participate, such as: suggesting practices to be researched; study initiatives; recommend literature; share insights or experience; collaborate in improving participation, equity and inclusion.

- Reports on project ambitions - It aims to problematize the insertion of activity records in laboratories in the colonial perspective of science - identified as extractivist, patriarchal, misogynist and mercantile. Was she strengthening or weakening this perspective?
Governance

- Adopts code of conduct - Reaffirms the need to be respectful @ with ideas, styles and to make invariable perspectives heard.
It provides the open canvas of the project - It allows the visualization of the main elements of the initiative, its differentials, to whom it is destined, and resources.

- Describes challenges to project governance - Recognizes that academic culture still encourages practices that are antagonistic to openness, committing themselves to: 1) recognizing and rewarding contributions equitably; 2) be transparent about decision making and information sharing; 3) Create multiple and inclusive paths for participation.

- Adopts license consistent with values of its community - The Creative Commons BY-SA-NC license was adopted because, although not the most permissive of all, it is consistent with the vision of some projects studied.

- Shares financing proposal 


Share financing proposal submitted for public tender

*Diversity*

- Promotes linguistic accessibility - The open research is developed in English, but it is indicated the possibility to work with in Portuguese and Spanish. 

<h2>Temporary last words</h2>

The project has not been fully publicized and the future challenges of its community are: 
- a) to work on the issue of engagement; 
- b) topics related to the safety of participants 
- c) cultural change.
