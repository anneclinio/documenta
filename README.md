Why open notebook science? - http://livroaberto.ibict.br/handle/1/1061	I am a Information Science researcher and I have studied "citizen laboratories" documentation practices in Spain and Brazil during my PHD process. I also was team member of Ubatuba Open Science Project, an action research that related open science with development issues. Since I study the commons perspective and practices as a third way of governance of the commons, I feel that I manage well theoretical aspects, but I lack knowledge to do it for real in terms of tools mobilization strategies.	I believe that the main challenge is being a jr researcher, that have to publish as much as we can get, in a secrecy culture. It is not clear to me (and I think to everyone) what contents/data we can open without damaging our future perspectives in terms of productivity indicators, opportunities, ternure, etc. Also, I lack all kinds of support. my investigation is totally as a volunteer.	Open data project or report, Bringing openness to my organizations	I believe that I could organize relevant content and questions to start a open community about documentation process in such spaces. I hope to find peers and develop further studies and methodologies, including a decolonial perspective (theme that is being widely discussed in Brazil nowadays).	I hope it can be the starting point of an open community about documentation practices that can work as a space for gathering researchers and practitioners. also helps strength spaces of informal education and social mobilization such as citizen labs, makerspaces, etc.
