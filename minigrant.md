# Mini Grant Proposal # 

*This is the version 1.0 of a mini grant proposal for Documenta!?*

This is part of Documenta?!, an open research about documentation practices in many kinds of laboratories that is being supported by Mozilla Open Leaders 7. The main idea is to restart Doc.Art prototype that volunteers have started during Collective Intelligence for Democracy Call, helded by Medialab Prado on November, 2017. The main goals of this application are: 

- Prototyping - To finish our very first development (open source code). Our metric here is having a functional prototype. Not only its idea or graphic design. 

- Community Building - To promote on-line meet ups and face to face workshops that foster cocreation, engagement and early adoption of Doc.Art. We have contact citizen laboratories and we want to showcase Doc.Art and promote its cocreation. 

- Curriculum - To improve our open materials (text, graphics videos) to facilitate its early adoption by others, specially citizen laboratories and activists. 

**Money will be used:** to research open solutions and write some code, to develop communication materials (translation, video and text edition) and promote cocreation and workshops with citizen labs (travel expenses).  

Our project will be successful if it makes sense to citizen labs. Our experience shows that, as other kinds of science, citizen labs lack documentation process that are agile, non bureaucratic and help them foster their communities of practice. Our previous research shows that most of the knowledge produced during the task forces they promote simply "disapear" when collaborators go back to their home. It mostly remain in people's heads and hearts. And the main reason is that groups are not intentionally leaving footprints of their work, they are not producing an external and long-term memory?. Most of them keep only the very first descriptions of their projects. Or adopts a journalist approach that report events, but do not share knowledge. The idea of Doc.Art is offering an agile documentation methodology by retrieving documentation pieces (grafemas) that populate citizen laboratories, such as post its, drafts, diagrams? in order to storyteller the development process. 

**Outcomes:**
- a better Doc.Art protoype
- communication materials, including a prototypedia
- a documentation community
- a better open research
